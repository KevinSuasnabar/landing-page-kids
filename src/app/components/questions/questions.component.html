                    <h2>Do you provide any scripts with your templates?</h2>
                    <p>Our templates do not include any additional scripts. Newsletter subscriptions, search fields,
                        forums, image galleries (in HTML versions of Flash products) are inactive. Basic scripts can
                        be easily added at www.zemez.io If you are not sure that the element you’re interested in is

                    <h2>What are the advantages of purchasing a website template?</h2>
                    <p>The major advantage is price: You get a high quality design for just $20-$70. You don’t have
                        to hire a web designer or web design studio. The second advantage is time frame: It usually
                        takes 5-15 days for a good designer to produce a web page of such quality regardless of its
                        purpose.</p>

                        redistribute templates (like we do); claim intellectual or exclusive ownership to any of our
